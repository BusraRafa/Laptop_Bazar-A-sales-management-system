## Key Features

- **Top-selling Laptops**: Identifies and lists the most popular laptops based on sales data.
- **Top Customers**: Retrieves and ranks customers by their total purchase amounts.
- **Laptop Recommendation**: Suggests laptops based on specifications like memory, storage, battery, and price using nearest neighbor logic.

## Technologies Used

- **PL/SQL**
- **Oracle Database**
- **Distributed Database Links**
- **Triggers and Procedures**
- **Views and Cursors**
## Global Schema
The global schema defines how the data is distributed and how tables are related across different sites. It includes the following key tables:

1. **Laptop (pid, brand, graphics, price, SID, BranchID)**
2. **Specification1 (pid, memory, storage, cpu_speed, battery, display)**
3. **Specification2 (pid, memory, storage, cpu_speed, battery, display)**
4. **Order_D (CID, pid, price)**
5. **Branch (BranchID, branch_name, location)**
6. **Customer (CID, name, contact_info)**
7. **Top_Selling (brand, popularity)**
8. **Seller_Sold (pid, seller_id, sold_count)**

## Fragmentation Schema

### Site 1
- **Laptop (pid, brand, graphics, price, SID, BranchID)**

- **Seller_Sold (pid, seller_id, sold_count)**
- **View (view_id, brand, graphics, price, SID, BranchID)**

### Site 2
- **Specification2 (pid, memory, storage, cpu_speed, battery, display)**
- **Distance2 (pid, df_memory, df_storage, df_cpu_speed, df_battery, df_display)**
- **Prediction (pid, predicted_price, predicted_specs)**
- **Connection (site_link)**
- **Distance1 (pid, df_memory, df_storage, df_cpu_speed, df_battery, df_display)**

## Allocation Schema
